# World mythological traditions analysis with machine learning methods

### Basic Pipeline

1. Download and clean text corpora
2. Build sentence and chunk embeddings
3. Build vector index and retrieval
4. Reduce embeddings dimensions with autoencoder and/or UMAP
5. Display colored semantic space
6. Extract ontology with Wikontic

### To Try

1. Relate to common motif indexes (or query by them)
2. Build exploratory UI with clusters visualization, adaptable threshold and freeform query
3. Try AE / VAE / SAE?
4. Try hierarchical chunking / embeddings?
5. ...
